In the waterfall approach, you'd create a detailed plan for one big release in the future. 
During that time, the market may change in ways that you should be adapting to,but you don't, because you continue to follow the original plan. 
Also, if you lose key team members during the development of the project, it will delay the entire projectbecause the original plan assumed that you would have the original team for the entire time. 
In a waterfall approach, change is hard and expensive. 
This is because you've created a big upfront plan and any changes can have major ripple effects for the rest of the project. 
A change later in the project life is especially difficult and expensive to make because a lot of work has already been put into the original design and the product isn't designed to handle changes like that. 
This is why in any waterfall projects, there's often a separate change management process for dealing with changes to the original plan. 
In a waterfall project, you tend to create a lot of obsolete documents. 
Because the waterfall approach assumes that the project will go through distinct phases while the product is being built, the output of one phase tends to include a document or 
documents that the next phase picks up and works with. 
This is problematic in many ways. 
The document may not be written in a way that the people in the next phase truly understand, resulting in waste. 
Also, as the next phase discovers things that need to change, they often don't update the documents from the previous phase causing the documents of the project to become out of sync and eventually obsolete. 
Also towards the end of waterfall projects, changes are often made because of discovery of last minute problems. 
These changes are often made without being properly documented causing the documents from previous phases to become further obsolete. 
In waterfall projects, the feedback on what you are doing often is drastically delayed. 
For example, let's say that you identified a high value feature during the analyze phase. 
That feature eventually is released when the product is released. 
This can be months or years after the high value feature was identified. 
That is a long time to wait to learn that your high valued feature is actually of low value. 
As another example, let's say there the software feature is built in the build phase. 
If testing is a separate phase, that test may be months after the feature was built. 
If the testing fails, the engineer who built it will barely remember building 
it or may no longer be available to help fix it. 
Delayed feedback like this is a source of waste in the project. 
A question that you may have is when is waterfall used? 
Well, if the setup cost for a phase is high, you tend to plan very carefully and work in big batches. 
In other words, if it takes a lot of time or expense to setup what is needed to send a single feature through a single phase, you tend to batch the features in order to achieve economies of scale. 
Let's look at software development as an example. 
In the not-too-distant past, companies had to buy computers used for every phase in the process. 
They would have to predict how many they would need, order them, wait for them to arrive and set them up. 
They would then have to install the software on the computers depending on how they used it.
