Agile is an approach to managing and working on projects. This means that it relates to both planning and doing the actual work. 
In other words, it includes aspects of project management and product development. 
Agile is a simple approach to managing complexity. 
This is an alternative to addressing complexity with complex project management and heavy upfront planning which often increases the overall complexity and risk of the project. 
Agile approaches can be applied to any type of project. 
The classic use of Agile is in software development. 
The use of the word Agile for this approach was coined by 
some leaders in the software industry in 2001. 
We will discuss this more when we discuss the Agile manifesto. 
Most modern software projects run using Agile approaches. 
If you name any company that produces software, there's a very good chance that some or all of the company is agile. 
Companies that are using old-fashioned approaches are usually at a disadvantage to their competitors. 
Agile techniques can also be used to manage service tickets. 
These can be tickets related to software issues or any other type of service ticket such as a restaurant order. 
Inside of a company, Agile approaches can be used in any department. 
For example, the human resources or HR department might use Agile techniques to manage the flow related to the new hire process. 
As another example, the marketing team might use them for managing a marketing initiative. 
Agile approaches do not have to be used in corporate situations. 
For example the tasks that need to be done at a picnic can be managed this way. 
If you are writing a book, Agile techniques can help you focus and write a better book. 
Agile can apply to team projects and to personal projects. 
Finally, even if you are building a rocket, you can use Agile techniques. 
SpaceX uses Agile approaches to continuously improve their products. 
You can see that Agile projects apply to working on physical products as well as on knowledge work like managing an HR process. 
In this course, we will generically use the word product to refer to both physical and less tangible deliverables of a project. 
Each Agile project is unique but they usually have some common characteristics. 
We will discuss them briefly now, then discuss each of these characteristics more throughout the course. 
Agile products are built incrementally. 
This means that instead of planning, building and releasing the product all at once,small valuable increments of the product are planned and released in a succession. 
The definition of release may vary by project. 
For example, an increment may actually go to the customer or the increment may be releasable subject to a business decision. 
Either way, each increment should be actually usable and valuable to the customer. 
Agile projects are iterative. 
This means that you continuously obtain feedback, learn and improve the product and the process of building the product. 
Each increment provides tight feedback from both the users and from inside the team allowing continuous improvement. 
Agile projects relentlessly focus on value. 
The team is always working on what it currently considers to be the highest value parts of the project. 
After the current work, the team again decides what is the next highest value thing to work on. 
This is based on continuous feedback from the team and from users of the product. 
Agile projects have an empowered team. 
This means that the team decides how to organize and how to accomplish its work. 
This is not a command and control system. 
You can think of the team as containing a distributed brain where each member continuously helps make decisions. 
In many cases, the members of the team have the most current knowledge and information and are in the best position to make a good quick decision. 
An Agile approach to managing projects is often chosen because the results are better than more traditional approaches. 
This is especially true when the project involves a lot of uncertainty. 
Let's start by looking from the customer's perspective at the benefits of products created by Agile teams. 
The customer is receiving a desirable product. This is because the customer consistently provides feedback in the development of the product. 
This feedback comes directly from customers or indirectly by evaluating the data related to product usage. 
The team is always focused on delivering the highest priority features which means customers are 
getting the most important features earlier than they would using traditional project management techniques. 
`Agile teams are consistently matching what they build to what the customer is asking for.` 
They embrace and respond quickly to change so even recent changes in the market can be accommodated as the product is built. 
Agile projects also lead to higher quality. The assumption is that team members are knowledgeable 
and will build with high-quality at all times. However, mistakes and unanticipated issues will arise. 
In Agile projects, feedback loops are short and mistakes are expected to be fixed when they are discovered. 
Agile projects also have benefits for the team. 
Agile teams often have higher job satisfaction. 
This is due to the culture of empowering team members to define the best way to work together. 
Leveraging the decision-making ability and creativity of all team members is not only good business, 
but creates a stronger sense of purpose for the team members. 
It also results in the use of a variety of skills and provides continuous learning opportunities. 
Agile projects lead to better innovation. 
The Agile approach is experimental in nature which allows innovative ideas to be quickly built and tested with real users. 
Because the team and the product are adaptable, the new ideas may or may not survive in the long term. 
Either way, the Agile team embraces the learning process involved. 
Companies that adopt Agile approaches have an entrepreneurial spirit to them and are much less likely to be disrupted by other companies. 
Agile products have lower costs than traditional projects. 
This is because you are consistently receiving feedback and focusing on value. 
You are not performing wasteful activities. 
Also any problems are resolved when they are discovered leading to lower rework costs. 
Agile projects are safer in the sense that risk is lowered because you are continuously getting feedback on what you are doing.
